      If you have an ad-blocking or tracker-blocking extension such as

        uBlock Origin
      </a>
      <strong>(recommended)</strong>, our Sentry system is already blocked by
      the built-in lists, so you do not have to worry about your privacy. You
      can also opt-out of error reporting in the
      <Link to="/settings">settings page</Link>. That said, if youâ€™d like to
      help us by providing more detailed error reports, then please consider
      making an exception for KristWeb in your tracker blocker software. This
      site does not serve ads.
